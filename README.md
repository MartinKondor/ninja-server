NINJA is an ultra secure messaging platform. Built with the MERN stack.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v16.13.0+
* In the main directory run the ```npm i``` command to simply install the dependencies.

### Usage

For the client side (React), see: [https://github.com/MartinKondor/ninja-client/](https://github.com/MartinKondor/ninja-client/).

To run the project make sure to do the following steps:
1. You have to define a few environmental variables before run:
  ```
  ATLAS_URI=...  # MongoDB atlas url
  PORT=...  # Port to run on
  API_KEY=...  # Api key for requests
  ```
  Put them in the ```config.env``` file in the main directory.
  
2. Then start the server with the ```npm start``` command.
3. Setup and start the [client side](https://github.com/MartinKondor/ninja-client/).
4. Now you can edit the files on both sides.
